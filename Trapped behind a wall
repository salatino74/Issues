I was completing the 'WynnExcavation Site B' quest and I got past the purple crystal room and into the portal to take me out of the cave.
Only now I'm trapped behind the portal and all I see is dirt, redstone, and the coal blocks that make up the portal along with some pistons.
There's not way out and I have no teleportation scroll so now my archer class is trapped there.
